# Mari8X Community - Messaging Guidelines

**Principle:** Be humble, respectful, and realistic

---

## ✅ DO SAY

**About Data:**
- "Data accumulates over time"
- "Builds historical insights as you use it"
- "The longer you run it, the more data you'll have"
- "Starts fresh, grows naturally"
- "Your deployment, your data"

**About AISstream.io:**
- "Powered by AISstream.io (free tier)"
- "Thanks to AISstream.io for free AIS access"
- "You need your own free API key from aisstream.io"
- "AISstream.io provides the data source"

**About Capabilities:**
- "Can track vessels globally"
- "Learns from accumulated position data"
- "Intelligence improves with usage"
- "Self-hosted, you control everything"

---

## ❌ DON'T SAY

**Avoid Bragging:**
- ❌ "11.6 million AIS positions"
- ❌ "17,000+ vessels tracked"
- ❌ "Most comprehensive AIS database"
- ❌ "More data than competitors"
- ❌ Any specific large numbers

**Why:** 
- Sounds like showing off
- Might upset data providers
- Creates unrealistic expectations (users start with 0)
- Could violate terms of service

**Avoid Taking Credit:**
- ❌ "We provide AIS data"
- ❌ "Our AIS coverage"
- ❌ "Mari8X's global vessel network"

**Why:**
- AISstream.io provides the data, not us
- Be grateful and respectful
- Give credit where due

**Avoid Unrealistic Promises:**
- ❌ "Guaranteed 100% uptime"
- ❌ "Never miss a vessel"
- ❌ "Real-time updates every second"

**Why:**
- Free tier has limitations
- We can't guarantee what we don't control
- Be honest about constraints

## 💬 EXAMPLE CONVERSATIONS

### "How much data does Mari8X have?"

❌ **Bad:** "We have 11.6 million AIS positions tracking 17,000 vessels!"

✅ **Good:** "Mari8X accumulates AIS data as your deployment runs. You start fresh, and historical data builds up naturally over time. The longer you run it, the more insights you'll have."

### "Where does the AIS data come from?"

❌ **Bad:** "We provide global AIS coverage from our network."

✅ **Good:** "Mari8X uses AISstream.io's free tier for real-time AIS data. You'll need to sign up for your own free API key at aisstream.io."

### "Is Mari8X as good as MarineTraffic?"

❌ **Bad:** "We're better! We have more data and it's free!"

✅ **Good:** "Mari8X is open source and self-hostable, so you own your data. It's a different approach - you build up your own database over time rather than paying for access to someone else's."
